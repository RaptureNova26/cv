    <li><a href="https://www.instagram.com/novice_flyfisher98/">Fishing</a>: Will always be my number one hobby until the day they have to take the rode off my cold dead hands.</li>
    <li>Reading: I don't do this to often as I tend to actually my video games more ,however, I believe reading does more for me than video games not matter what I read so it will always top it </li>
    <li>Hiking/outdoor activities: I love the outdoors and anything that has to do will leaving behind society/civilization.</li>
    <li>Video Games: I do more of this than anyother thing, but even then I will much rather do the activities stated above more than this.</li>
