        <li>
          Don't recall much from this school as it was when I was really young. Much of my memories in califronia are very vague and almost nonexisten and as such I don't recall where this school is nor its name.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li><a href="https://www.springfield.k12.or.us/maple">Maple Elementry</a>: This school was begin rebuilt while I was in the 5th grade and as such it does not look like the builing I was going to at the time. You can no longer tell where the old
      building stood but there are pictures of it still on the interent for peoples refrence.</li>
    <li><a href="http://blog.springfield.k12.or.us/trdr/">Spingfield Middle School</a>:This school no longer exists as it was closed down due to not enough students begin present in the school. It was converted to a elementry school called Two
      Rivers- Dos Rios which is a school that was filled with students of two elementry schools that also closed down.</li>
